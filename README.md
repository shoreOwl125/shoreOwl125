👋 Hi, I'm an M.Sc. Computer Science candidate 👨‍💻 specializing in Data Science and AI at San Francisco State University.
With a foundation in Computer Science from WGU and a penchant for solving complex problems,
I've melded my academic knowledge with hands-on experience at Meta and as a graduate researcher under NSF's I-Corps Program.
My skills range from Python and SQL to ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
I'm passionate about leveraging data to unlock insights and create innovative solutions.
Currently, I'm sharing what I've learned in Machine Learning as a TA,
while also exploring the frontiers Large Language Models and Computer Vision.
